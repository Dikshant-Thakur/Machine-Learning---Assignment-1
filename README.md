# Naive Bayes Classifier Assignment
This assignment is centered around the implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier. The project is divided into four key programs, each contributing to the understanding and functionality of this classifier.

**Part 1: Data Shuffling and Set Preparation**
The initial phase involves data handling. The program shuffles the data to enhance accuracy and then splits it into training and test sets. This step is crucial for ensuring the robustness of the classifier.

**Part 2: Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation**
In the second segment, the focus shifts to creating the Naive Bayes classifier function. This function is designed to operate seamlessly without requiring user intervention, showcasing the algorithm's capability to make predictions independently.

**Part 3: Handling Missing Data with Laplace Smoothing**
The third part enhances the classifier's robustness by incorporating Laplace (additive) smoothing to handle missing data. This technique ensures more reliable predictions even when confronted with incomplete information.

**Part 4: Handling Continuous Variables**
Lastly, the assignment explores handling continuous variables within the Naive Bayes classifier. It discusses techniques to manage numerical errors, suggesting the use of logarithmic probabilities and exploring how to adapt the classifier for continuous data. An experiment is proposed using the Iris dataset to convert continuous features into binary values for analysis
